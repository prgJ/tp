### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `Coach2K22Parser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `Coach2K22Parser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `Coach2K22Parser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores `Note` objects in three separate lists for each `Person` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Contact Management

#### 4.1.1 Add Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to add persons to the person list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#addPerson()` to add a new person to the person list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `add-p n/Johnson p/83918273 a/Woodlands Avenue 4 e/johnson@gmail.com` to add a new person to the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#addPerson()` is called which adds the new person to an internal list and updates the GUI display. A new contact named "Johnson" with his relevant details is then shown in the person list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddPersonSequenceDiagram](images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `add-p` command for creating a person.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `add` command that adds tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.2 Delete Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to delete persons from the person list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#deletePerson()` to delete a person from the person list. The method `#setTask()` is also called to ensure that the deleted person is removed from all tasks.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `del-p 1` to delete the first person in the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `DeletePersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `DeletePersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` method is called multiple times to remove the
corresponding person from all the tasks in the task list. After which, the `ModelManager#deletePerson()` method is called to delete the specified person from the person list.

Step 5: The GUI display is then updated to show a new contact and task list without the deleted person.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![DeletePersonSequenceDiagram](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `del-p` command for deleting a person.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `del` command that deletes tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.3 Edit Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to edit persons from the person list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` to update a person from the person list. If the person's name is edited in this process, the method `#setTask()` will be called to ensure all tasks tagged with this person is updated according.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the edit person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `edit-p 1 n/Johnson` to edit the first person in the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `EditPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `EditPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` method is called multiple times to update the
name of the corresponding person in all the tasks. After which, the `ModelManager#setPerson()` method is called to update the specified person in the person list.

Step 5: The GUI display is then updated to show a new contact and task list with the updated person details.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![EditPersonSequenceDiagram](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `edit-p` command for editing a person.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `edit` command that edits tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.4 Clear Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows users to clear all persons from the person list.
It is facilitated by the `ModelManager` which sets a new `AddressBook` object to the `ModelManager` to clear the person list. The method `#setTask()` will also be called to ensure all tasks do not have any persons tagged to it.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the clear person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `clear-p` to clear all persons from the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into the `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable
parser class which corresponds with the provided command to parse the user's inputs.

Step 3: Since there are no arguments for this command, a newly initialised `ClearPersonCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` method is called multiple times to delete persons in all the tasks. After which, a new `AddressBook` object is passed into the `ModelManager#setAddressBook()` method which clears out the person list.

Step 5: The GUI display is then updated to show an empty contact and new task list without any persons tagged to the tasks.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![ClearPersonSequenceDiagram](images/ClearPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be separate clear commands for clearing tasks and persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate command for clearing tasks and persons.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.
* **Alternative 2:** A combined command for clearing tasks and persons.
  earPer  * Pros: Easier and more intuitive for the user to understand
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.5 Add Tags Feature

##### Implementation
This feature allows the user to add tags to contacts in the list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` and `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to add tags to a contact.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `tag-add-p 1 friend` to add the tag "friend" to the first contact in the list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddPersonTagCommandParser` where its method `#parse` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddPersonTagCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution. This `AddPersonTagCommand` contains information about the new tag (in this case, "friend")

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setPerson()` is called which edits the tags of the person with the user-supplied tags. The filtered person list is updated with `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList` to display the new information to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddPersonTagSequenceDiagram](images/AddPersonTagSequenceDiagram.png)


##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should the implementation use the existing edit functionalities in Coach2K22:**
* **Alternative 1:**  Use the current EditCommand class to edit a person's tags.
    * Pros: Maintains abstraction and reuses code instead of writing new code.
    * Cons: Creates a cyclic dependency, making the code base harder to maintain later on

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement AddPersonTagCommand independently, rewriting similar code
    * Pros: Cleaner code and less dependencies
    * Cons: Repetitive code that is not abstracted

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.6 Delete Tags Feature

##### Implementation
This feature allows the user to delete tags from contacts in the list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` and `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to delete tags from a contact.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user `tag-del-p 1 friend` to delete the tag "friend" from the first contact in the list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `DeletePersonTagCommandParser` where its method `#parse` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `DeletePersonTagCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution. This `DeletePersonTagCommand` contains information about the new tag (in this case, "friend")

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setPerson()` is called which edits the tags of the person with the user-supplied tags. The filtered perosn list is updated with `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList` to display the new information to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![DeletePersonTagSequenceDiagram](images/DeletePersonTagSequenceDiagram.png)


##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should the implementation use the existing edit functionalities in AB3:**
* **Alternative 1:**  Use the current EditCommand class to edit a person's tags.
    * Pros: Maintains abstraction and reuses code instead of writing new code.
    * Cons: Creates a cyclic dependency, making the code base harder to maintain later on

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement DeletePersonTagCommand independently, rewriting similar code
    * Pros: Cleaner code and less dependencies
    * Cons: Repetitive code that is not abstracted

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.7 Find Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to display selected persons in the contact list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to find persons by name or tag.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the find person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `find n/Alex t/friends` to find selected persons.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `FindPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `FindPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called which updates the GUI display with only selected persons shown in the contact list. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![FindPersonSequenceDiagram](images/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be a separate find command for name and tag:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A combined command for finding name and tag.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users may have to remember more prefixes.

* **Alternative 2:** A separate command for finding name and tag.
    * Pros: Commands may be more intuitive to the users.
    * Cons: Possible violation of the DRY principle.

**Aspect: Should there be separate find commands for finding tasks and persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate command for finding tasks and persons.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.

* **Alternative 2:** A combined command for finding tasks and persons.
    * Pros: Easier and more intuitive for the user to understand.
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.7 Add Strength/Weakness/Misc Features

##### Implementation

These features allow the user to add a strength, weakness, or miscellaneous note to a person in the person list . It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` to replace the particular person with the new person with modified note list (depending on the given command).

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the Add Strength mechanism behaves at each step._Note that three commands have similar implementations, so only the Add Strength feature implementation will be provided here._

Step 1: The user inputs `strength-add 1 great endurance` to add the strength `great endurance` to the person in index `1` of the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddStrengthCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddStrengthCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, `ModelManager#setPerson()` method is called to update the specified person in the person list with the new strength list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below. Note that all occurrences of `Strength` or `AddStrengthCommand` (and similar instances) will be generalized to `Note` and `AddNoteCommand` respectively to represent the implementation of the Add Strength, Weakness, and Misc features.
![AddNoteSequenceDiagram](images/AddNoteSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be different note lists for each person:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `note-add` command into three different commands.
    * Pros: Easier to use and more intuitive.
    * Cons: Difficult to extend and modify.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `note-add` command for adding to each list with provided prefixes.
    * Pros: Easier to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not intuitive for the user and more prone to feature flaws

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.8 Delete Strength/Weakness/Misc Features

##### Implementation

These features allow the user to delete a strength, weakness, or miscellaneous note from a person in the person list . It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` to replace the particular person with the new person with modified note list (depending on the given command).

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the Delete Strength mechanism behaves at each step._Note that three commands have similar implementations, so only the Delete Strength feature implementation will be provided here._

Step 1: The user inputs `strength-del 1 1` to delete the first strength from the person in index `1` of the person list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `DeleteStrengthCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `DeleteStrengthCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, `ModelManager#setPerson()` method is called to update the specified person in the person list with the new strength list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below. Note that all occurrences of `Strength` or `DeleteStrengthCommand` (and similar instances) will be generalized to `Note` and `AddNoteCommand` respectively to represent the implementation of the Delete Strength, Weakness, and Misc features.
![DeleteNoteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteNoteSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be different note lists for each person:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `note-del` command into three different commands.
  * Pros: Easier to use and more intuitive.
  * Cons: Difficult to extend and modify.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `note-del` command for adding to each list with provided prefixes.
  * Pros: Easier to extend and modify.
  * Cons: Not intuitive for the user and more prone to feature flaws

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.9 Sort by Strength/Weakness Features

##### Implementation

These features allow the user to sort the person list by the total number of strengths/weaknesses in descending order. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setAddressBook()` to replace the address book with the newly sorted person list without modification.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the Sort Strength mechanism behaves at each step._Note that two commands have similar implementations, so only the Sort Strength feature implementation will be provided here._

Step 1: The user inputs `sort-strength` to sort the entire person list by total number of strengths in descending order.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find the command class to process the command.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `SortStrengthCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, `ModelManager#setAddressBook()` method is called to update the person list with the newly sorted list of persons based on total number of strengths in descending order.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below. Note that all occurrences of `Strength` or `SortStrengthCommand` (and similar instances) will be generalized to `Note` and `SortNoteCommand` respectively to represent the implementation of the Sort by Strength and Weakness features.
![SortNoteSequenceDiagram](images/SortNoteSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be different sorting functions for address book and schedule:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use different commands for sorting the address book and schedule.
  * Pros: Easier to use and more intuitive.
  * Cons: Difficult to extend and modify.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `sort` command for sorting the `AddressBook` and `TaskBook`.
  * Pros: Easier to extend and modify.
  * Cons: Not intuitive for the user and difficult to implement

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.2 Task Management

#### 4.2.1 Add Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to add tasks to the task list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#addTask()` to add a new task to the task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `add-t n/Meet d/11-11-2022 st/11:00 et/01:00` to add a new task to the task list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddTaskCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddTaskCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#addTask()` is called which adds the new task to an internal list and updates the GUI display. A new task named "Meet" with the subsequent date and time details is then shown in the task list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for tasks:**

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `del-t 1` to delete the first task in the task list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `DeleteTaskCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `DeleteTaskCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#deleteTask()` is called which deletes the specified person from an internal list and updates the GUI display. A new task list without the deleted task then shown.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for tasks:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `del-t` command for deleting a task.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `del` command that deletes tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

#### 4.2.3 Add Tags Feature

##### Implementation
This feature allows the user to add tags to tasks in the list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setTask()` and `#updateFilteredTaskList()` to add tags to a task.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `tag-add-t 1 important` to add the tag "friend" to the first task in the list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddTaskTagCommandParser` where its method `#parse` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddTaskTagCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution. This `AddTaskTagCommand` contains information about the new tag (in this case, "important")

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` is called which edits the tags of the task with the user-supplied tags. The filtered task list is updated with `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList` to display the new information to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.

#### 4.2.4 Delete Tags Feature

##### Implementation
This feature allows the user to delete tags from tasks in the list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setTask()` and `#updateFilteredTaskList()` to delete tags from a task.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `tag-del-t 1 important` to delete the tag "important" from the first task in the list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `DeleteTaskTagCommandParser` where its method `#parse` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `DeleteTaskTagCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution. This `DeleteTaskTagCommand` contains information about the tag to be deleted (in this case, "important")

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` is called which edits out the tag from the task. The filtered task list is updated with `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList` to display the new information to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.

makes use of the method `#setTask()` to update a task from the task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the edit task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `edit-p 1 n/Meeting` to edit the first task in the task list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `EditTaskCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `EditTaskCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setTask()` is called which edits the specified task from an internal list and updates the GUI display. A new task list with the updated task details is then shown.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![EditTaskSequenceDiagram](images/EditTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for tasks:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `edit-t` command for editing a task.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `edit` command that edits tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
    
#### 4.2.6 Clear Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows users to clear all tasks from the task list, or only tasks that correspond with a given date.
It is facilitated by the `ModelManager` which utilizes the method `deleteTask()` to delete each corresponding task one
by one, or sets a new `TaskBook` object to the `ModelManager` to refresh the task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the clear task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `clear-t 2022-10-10` to clear all tasks that correspond with the date `2022-10-10` in the task list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into the `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable
parser class which corresponds with the provided command to parse the user's inputs. This initializes the `ClearTaskCommandParser`,
where its method `parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: The newly initialized `ClearTaskCommandParser` is then returned to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#deleteTask()` method is called multiple times to remove the
corresponding tasks from the internal task list. Inside the function call, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()`
is also called, which updates the GUI to display the new task list. The command results are then generated and shown to
the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![ClearTaskSequenceDiagram](images/ClearTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be separate clear commands for clearing tasks and players:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate command for clearing tasks and players.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.
* **Alternative 2:** A combined command for clearing tasks and player.
    * Pros: Easier and more intuitive for the user to understand
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.7 Find Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to display selected tasks in the task list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#updateFilteredTaskList()` to find tasks by name or tag.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the find task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `find n/meeting t/friends` to find selected tasks.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `FindTaskCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `FindTaskCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()` is called which updates the GUI display with only selected tasks shown in the task list. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![FindTaskSequenceDiagram](images/FindTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be a separate find command for name and tag:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A combined command for finding name and tag.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users may have to remember more prefixes.

* **Alternative 2:** A separate command for finding name and tag.
    * Pros: Commands may be more intuitive to the users.
    * Cons: Possible violation of the DRY principle.

**Aspect: Should there be separate find commands for finding tasks and persons:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate command for finding tasks and persons.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.

* **Alternative 2:** A combined command for finding tasks and persons.
    * Pros: Easier and more intuitive for the user to understand.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.8 Get Person Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to retrieve contact details of persons tagged to a selected task in the task list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to get persons tagged to a task.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the get person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `get-person 1` to retrieve contact details of persons tagged to the first task.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `GetPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `GetPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called. The GUI display then updates the person list - showing only the contact details of persons tagged to the specified task.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![GetPersonSequenceDiagram](images/GetPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.9 Sort by Date Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to sort the task list in chronological order. The resulting task list will be sorted by earliest date and time first.
It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which makes use of the method `#getUnfilteredTaskList()` to get the list of tasks.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the sort date mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `sort-date` to sort the task list by date.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22#parseCommand()`. Since this command does not require parameters, the SortTaskByDateCommand object is created directly instead of through a Parser.

Step 3: The newly initialised `SortTaskByDateCommand` is returned back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the current list of tasks is sorted using an internal sorting algorithm, then a new TaskBook object is created to store the new ordered list of tasks.

Step 5: The model replaces its old TaskBook with the new sorted TaskBook using `ModelManager#setTaskBook`, and the GUI updates the task list accordingly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddPlayerCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddPlayerCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#addPlayer()` is called which adds the new player to an internal list and updates the GUI display with a new player named "Cena" shown in the strategy board. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddPlayerSequenceDiagram](images/AddPlayerSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for players:**

* **Alternative 1:** A player is a String of player name.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** A player is an object of class `Player`.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and manipulate attributes of a player.
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.3.2 Load Court Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to load an image to serve as the background of the strategy board. It is facilitated by `CommandResult` which
carries a representation of the image to the `MainWindow` to update the background of the strategy board accordingly.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the load court mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `load-court basketball` to load the image from the filepath `courts/basketball.png` to serve as the background of strategy board.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `LoadCourtCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `LoadCourtCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `CommandResult` object is returned to the `MainWindow`, where `CommandResult#getBackgroundImage()` is called to retrieve the image representation. Then, `MainWindow#handleLoadImage(back)` is called to update the background of the strategy board with a new image. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![LoadCourtSequenceDiagram](images/LoadCourtSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the deleting player mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `del-player Cena` to remove a player named `Cena` from the strategy board.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `DelPlayerCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `DeletePlayerCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#deletePlayer()` is called which remove the player from an internal list and updates the GUI display with a new player named "Cena" shown in the strategy board. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![DeletePlayerSequenceDiagram](images/DeletePlayerSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should allow users to remove multiple players at once:**

* **Alternative 1:** Users can remove multiple players at once.
    * Pros: Possibly improve the efficiency for users.
    * Cons: User inputs are more prone to errors.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Users can only remove one player at a time.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users need to repeat the same command multiple times to remove multiple players.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.3.4 Move Feature

##### Implementation

This feature allows the user to move players on the strategy board. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which

## **8. Appendix: Effort**

1. The team has extended the program to deal with three different entity types: `Person`, `Task`, `Strategy`. These entities are interconnected where features specific to `Person` may directly affect the `Task` entity. Deliberate and extensive checks are implemented across features to ensure functional correctness.
   
2. The team has implemented a JavaFX strategy board with draggable nodes. In addition, a `move` feature is implemented to cater to existing requirements. It was tough to implement this as nodes placements are determined by its relative position. Our team also tried to get these placements as accurate as possible to ensure functional correctness - increasing the implementation difficulty levels.
